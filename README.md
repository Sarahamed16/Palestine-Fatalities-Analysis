----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Project Overview:
-------------------
This project provides a comprehensive data analysis of Palestinian fatalities caused by Israeli military aggression over the past two decades. 
By leveraging data visualization, statistical exploration, and interactive dashboards, the project highlights the scale of suffering and loss experienced by the Palestinian people.

Project Components:
---------------------
Data Cleaning & Processing – Handling missing values, filtering relevant data, and preparing it for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying trends in fatalities by age, gender, location, and cause of death.

Visualizations (Python & Power BI) – Creating impactful graphs and an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Key Insights – Demonstrating how most fatalities were civilian casualties, disproving combat-related justifications.

Final Report – A structured PDF summarizing findings and advocating for humanitarian awareness.

Key Findings:
--------------
Fatalities have increased over time, especially during military escalations.

Most victims were civilians, including women and children.

Gunfire and airstrikes were the most common causes of death.

Gaza and the West Bank suffered the highest number of casualties.

Many victims were not involved in hostilities, proving the indiscriminate nature of violence.

Conclusion:
------------
This data-driven analysis exposes the ongoing atrocities faced by Palestinians under Israeli occupation.
The figures presented here are not just numbers; they represent real lives lost, families destroyed, and a deep humanitarian crisis. 
By using data, we aim to raise awareness and push for justice, accountability, and international intervention.
